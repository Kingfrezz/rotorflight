***

Rotorflight is a Flight Control/FBL Software Suite for traditional single-rotor RC helicopters.

It is based on Betaflight 4.2, enjoying all the great features of the Betaflight platform, plus many new features added for helicopters. Rotorflight borrows ideas and code also from Heliflight3D, an earlier fork of Betaflight for helicopters.

Rotorflight does **NOT** support multi-rotor crafts, nor airplanes; it is only for traditinal RC helicopters, including co-axial and tandem helicopters.


## NEWS

The **Rotorflight v1.0.2** is now available!

Please download the latest version here:

- The Configurator is available for download [here](https://github.com/rotorflight/rotorflight-configurator/releases/tag/release/1.0.2).
- The Blackbox is available for download [here](https://github.com/rotorflight/rotorflight-blackbox/releases/tag/release/1.0.1).
- The Transmitter LUA scripts are available for download [here](https://github.com/rotorflight/rotorflight-lua-scripts/releases/tag/release/1.0.1).

and follow the instructions in the [Wiki](https://github.com/rotorflight/rotorflight/wiki/Installing-Rotorflight-Firmware).


## Information

For latest information, please see [Rotorflight Wiki](https://github.com/rotorflight/rotorflight/wiki)


## Features

Rotorflight has many features:

* Great GUI application for setting up and configuration
* Advanced PID control, tuned for helicopters
* Main rotor speed governor
* Precompensation between collective/cyclic/yaw
* Advanced gyro filtering for helicopters
  - Dynamic RPM based notch filter banks
  - Advanced dynamic LPF
* Fully customisable servo/motor mixer
* Flexible servo configuration
* Flight Profiles (Banks)
* In-flight settings adjustment from RC channels

Plus lots of features inherited from Betaflight:

* Blackbox Flight logger
* Multiple ESC protocols: DShot, Multishot, Oneshot, and traditional PWM
* Multiple RX telemetry protocols: CSRF, FrSky, HoTT, MSP, etc.
* Telemetry inputs for RSSI, battery voltage, current sensors, etc.
* Multi-color RGB LEDs
* Configurable buzzer sounds
* GPS support

And many more...


## Hardware support

Generally speaking, Rotorflight supports all flight controller hardware that is supported by Betaflight.
With a caveat that the flight controller must have enough suitable I/O pins for connecting all the servos
and motors required by a collective pitch helicopter.

Also, the FC boards are typically labeled for multi-rotor use - thus the user needs to understand how these
functions can be used for a different purpose with helicopters. Usually this is just about using some
of the motor outputs for servos, but in some cases a more advanced remapping may be needed.

It is recommended to use a STM32F7 or STM32F4 based flight controller, as Rotorflight greatly benefits from
the latest filtering algorithms and other new features that are all CPU intensive. The faster F405 is a better 
option than the older and slower F411, but both can be made to work.

The old F3 flight controllers are not supported.

## Credits

Rotorflight is Free Software. Meaning, it is available free of charge _without warranty_, the source code is available, and it is supported by the users themselves as a community. Rotorflight is under the GPLv3 license.

Rotorflight is forked from Betaflight, which in turn is forked from Cleanflight.
Rotorflight borrows ideas and code also from Heliflight-3D, another Betaflight fork for helis.
